# Laravel API boilerplate üöÄ

An awesome boilerplate for your next Laravel 9 based API. It's only goal is to simply **kick-start your API development** and provide you with some of the best practices when building amazing and scalable REST APIs üî•

## Features üç≠

### REST API Best Practices
We baked in all the best REST API practices in terms of structuring your API, naming conventions, HTTP methods, responses, and optimizations.
	
### Concrete examples
We all like to learn by examples and that's why  the boilerplate comes with a concrete example that include everything from folder structure, routes to naming controllers.

### Scaffolding Artisan command
Tired of manually creating controllers, resources, test and form requests each time for new API endpoints? We were too. That's why we added a command that does all of that for you. Just run `php artisan treblle:make` and you get everything you need in a second.</dd>

### Built-in versioning
Building a versioning system that scales is always hard and that's why we built in a robust versioning system that is easy to use and can grow with the project.</dd>

### Single responsibility controllers
The boilerplate uses single responsibility controllers that make it painfully obvious what's going on and can be used with different versions.

### Models, migrations and factories
We built two tables Users and Posts and defined everything you might need on a database and model level.

### Sanctum authentication
Built in Laravel Sanctum authentication included in the boilerplate.

### Magical UUID trait
Want to use UUIDs but find it to much work just use our built in `InteractsWithUuid` trait and have fun with UUIDs.

### Spawn a new user quickly
Easily create a new user without messing around with database clients or CRUD systems by using our custom command `php artisan user:create`

### Treblle built-in
We added an awesome Laravel package called Treblle. Out of the box Treblle gives you: real-time API monitoring, automatically generated and updated documentation, error tracking and logging, API analytics, quality scoring and much more. To get started with Treblle just run `php artisan treblle:start` and follow the instructions or visit [treblle.com](https://treblle.com) for more information
